                <span className="text-lg">and Iâ€™m a high school junior in Seattle. I love taking photos, fixing electronics, playing video games, and competing with my team in the FIRST Robotics Competition. I have been interested in photography for a long time but really fell in love with it after getting my first real camera for my 17th birthday. I am largely self-taught and driven by a desire to improve my skills, while I did attend a class in school, I found it to be largely unhelpful.  Some of my favorite photos have been taken in amazing places with friends and family and through photography I am able to capture moments and express the mood in a scene. I think photography is very interesting and look forward to expanding my skills in techniques and editing.</span>
